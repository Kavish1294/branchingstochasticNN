## Validation suite

### Purpose

`bsnn_validation.py` does not take the manuscript's math on faith. It re-checks each
central claim by simulation, exact linear algebra, **independent reverse-mode automatic
differentiation** (the `autograd` package), and finite differences.

| Test | Manuscript claim | Method |
|------|------------------|--------|
| **T1** | Branching PGF factorization `G_{x+y}=G_x·G_y` (Thm 4.3) | Analytic (Poisson head) + Monte-Carlo with a correlated **non-Poisson** offspring law |
| **T2** | Mean `x_{n+1}=M x_n` and covariance `Σ_{n+1}=MΣ_nMᵀ+ΣᵢxₙᵢVᵢ` (Thm 6.1) | 400k-trajectory simulation vs. closed-form recursions |
| **T3** | `‖xₙ‖^{1/n} → ρ(M)`, three regimes + critical limit vector (Thm 7.1) | Normalized power iteration; Perron-vector check |
| **T4** | Extinction = minimal fixed point of `q=g(q)`; `ρ⋚1` dichotomy (Thm 7.3 / App A) | Fixed-point iteration vs. simulated extinction frequency |
| **T5** | Backprop through the mean model **==** adjoint sensitivity (Thm 10.1) | Adjoint vs. `autograd` vs. finite differences |
| **T6** | Dominant-eigenvalue sensitivity `dρ/dθ = uᵀ(dM)v` (Thm 10.2) | Closed form vs. finite differences |
| **T7** | Discrete-adjoint benchmarks (Sec 10.1 & 11.1) | Exact 3-cell rationals; AES `AD == adjoint == FD` to roundoff |
| **T8** | BSNN vs. RNNs + homogeneity/additivity limits (Sec 12 & 14) | Fit 3 models; measure structural violations |
| **T9** | Finite-sample Hoeffding bound for `M̂` (Thm 9.1) | Empirical coverage over 3,000 trials |

**Result:** all **26/26** checks pass. The 3-cell benchmark reproduces the paper's exact
rationals (`J = 8/85`, `dJ/dθ = −1072/7225`), and reverse-mode AD matches the hand-derived
adjoint to ~1e-17.

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`
- `autograd`  (for the independent gradient check)

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib autograd
```

### Run

```bash
python3 bsnn_validation.py
```

It prints a PASS/FAIL line per check with quantitative diagnostics, a summary, and writes
the three figures to the working directory. Exit code is `0` iff all checks pass.

### Architecture

The suite is organized in four layers:

1. **Models** — `OffspringLaw` (abstract) with `PoissonOffspring`, `BinomialOffspring`,
   `MultinomialFissionOffspring`; a single `BranchingProcess` that composes any law.
2. **Analysis** — `MeanFieldOperator` (spectral radius, Perron vectors, moment
   propagation, power iteration), `ExtinctionSolver`, `MeanRecurrenceAdjoint`,
   `EigenvalueSensitivity`, and the `DiscreteAdjointBenchmark` subclasses.
3. **Fitting** — `SequenceModel` (abstract) with `BSNNMeanModel`, `LinearRNNModel`,
   `NonlinearRNNModel`; plus `StructureDiagnostics`.
4. **Validation** — a `CheckResult` dataclass, a `Reporter`, an abstract `Validator`,
   eight concrete validators (one per theorem area), and a `ValidationSuite` orchestrator.

Adding a new check is a new `Validator` subclass registered in `ValidationSuite`.

## How to read the results

Passing these tests validates the manuscript's **internal mathematical consistency** — that
the theorems are correctly stated and the benchmarks reproduce. It does **not** validate the
*physical* premise that real fission satisfies the independent-branching approximation; that
is an empirical modeling question outside the manuscript's synthetic scope. The manuscript's
own §12 (expressivity limits) and Appendix C (limitations) should be read alongside these
results.
